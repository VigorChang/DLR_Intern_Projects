# DLR Internship Projects

[TOC]

## Introduction

These projects and documentation are what I have done during my internship at DLR. Following is the description on my CV.

1. Learning and studying the basic knowledge of Cyclone V ARM-FPGA chip and Arrow SoCKit development board, mainly focus on the interface of ARM-FPGA and HSMC protocol.
2. Studying the structure of Myriad RF project, using QDPSK to transmit data.
3. Send radio data to antenna directly by ARM, then ARM to FPGA to antenna to process the original data more quickly.
4. Program the ARM and FPGA to communicate with another board by radio, which will be used in a rover.
5. Find best data structure of command and channel coding method, to control the rover in low SNR situation (e.g. outer space).

I think I will change them in the future, if I have time to do that. :)
